# pf-correction-simulation-in-a-garments-factory

## Overview
This is a simple simulink project demonstrating the effect of adding capacitive load to a factory on improving the overall power factor. The loads in the factory were different during the day. So the optimum value of capacitance was needed to be calculated by observing the overall pf of the factory during the whole day. 

Additionally the time by which the money invested on buying capacitors eventually pays off was also calculated.
